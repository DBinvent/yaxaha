# YaXAHA Cluster Integration Tests

We run our tests on Debian-based Linux distributions and canâ€™t give any promises about the compatibility with many other versions and distros, except for those we use ourselves in development now. Last tests were made on Ubuntu 22.10 and Debian 11.

YaXAHA Cluster is written in Rust and out of habit we use cargo-make in the integration tests.

## Preparations

This instruction assumes that you have _sudo_ command installed and there is a sudo user in your system. If you have a fresh system installed, no sudo command, or no sudo user in the system, additional steps will be required.

Make sure the _sudo_ command is installed. Under _root_ user, run:

```shell
apt install -y sudo
```

Then create a new user and add it to the sudo group.

```shell
adduser username
adduser username sudo
```

After the log-in with the user created, you can copy-and-paste commands from the next steps and everything should go nice and smooth. To log in with the user created, please run:

```shell
su - username
```

Before you can start YaXAHA Cluster Integration Tests, you'll need to install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/) server with psql frontend, Rust, cargo-make tool with several dependencies and a few utilities we have adopted in the test scripts. Please run the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git uuid lsb-release postgresql
```

Now we can install Rust. To save time, we took the instructions from https://rustup.rs for supported Linux distributions. Run the following command:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

![Installing Cargo](https://github.com/DBinvent/yaxaha/blob/main/images/cargo-installation.jpg?raw=true)

Before Rust will be installed, the script will ask you to specify the settings. Default settings should be OK, you can press ```Enter``` here.

![Configuring the current shell](https://github.com/DBinvent/yaxaha/blob/main/images/configure-shell-for-cargo.jpg?raw=true)

After Rust is installed, we need to configure current shell:

```shell
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

In our last preparation step we need to install the _cargo-make_ tool that we heavily use in testing.

```shell
cargo install cargo-make
```

Now, everything is ready for the YaXAHA Cluster installation and running the integration tests.

## Installing YaXAHA Cluster

Please download and install the public signing key:

```shell
wget -O - https://www.dbinvent.com/dist/DBinventLLC.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add our repository to your sources.list:

```shell
echo "deb http://apt.dbinvent.com/focal focal non-free" > sudo /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dbinvent.list
```

Install the YaXAHA Cluster package:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yaxaha
```

Then run ytsetup to install the PostgreSQL extension and finally enable YaXAHA Cluster.

```shell
sudo ytsetup
```

And now we are ready to perform the YaXAHA Cluster integration tests.

## Running the tests

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DBinvent/yaxaha.git
```

Then cd into the yaxaha directory.

```shell
cd yaxaha
```

Now you can run an integration test that will locally create three copies of PostgreSQL, run them on different ports as if they were three independent cluster nodes, then run some tests and shut down all nodes.

> Note: the PG_VER parameter specifies the PostgreSQL version installed. Different Linux distributions have different PostgreSQL versions onboard, for example, Debian 11 comes with PostgreSQL v.13, while Ubuntu 22.10 comes with v.14.

To run several nodes in parallel:

```shell
cargo make --env PG_VER=14 --env CNT=3
```

Run individual node with ID=$NODE_ID and psql:
```shell
cargo make --makefile node.toml --env NID=$NODE_ID --env psql=1
```

Run single node with ID=1 and psql:
```shell
cargo make --makefile node.toml --env NID=1 --env psql=1 --env CNT=1 --env INIT=it_init_single.sql
```


## AUTO RUN:

Run all nodes on single console and run all test scenarios. 
- `cargo make`


If failed then run:
- `cargo make killall`


## MANUAL RUN:

Execution order:

1. it_init.sql
2. it_preparetest.sql
3. it_test.sql -- runs only on NODE=1


0. edit `it_init.sql` if want to change debug level and nodes 
1. build on /tests/ `cargo make build`
2. run on three console tabs:
   1.  `cargo make --makefile node.toml --env psql=1 --env NID=1`
   2.  `cargo make --makefile node.toml --env psql=1 --env NID=2`
   3.  `cargo make --makefile node.toml --env psql=1 --env NID=3`

 - Must not ERROR
 - One should have 'Cluster got a new leader', while others: 'confirmed_to_term'
 - you have psql
 - you can check with:
 `select * from json_to_recordset(yt.yt_info('E')) as x(name text, module text, value text);`
 - should have 'cluster': end with 'Leadr' and T:1 (term)

### Now cluster is ready

3. Run on one: `begin; insert into yt_config(name, value) values ('test0', 'test10');`
4. `select yt.yt_complete(true);`
5. `commit;`
6. check on others: `select * from yt_config where value = 'test10';`

7. to stop yt&pg servers type: `\q`
